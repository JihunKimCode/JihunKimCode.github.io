        <strong>Q. What is N-queens puzzle?</strong>
        <p>
            A. Check this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia Page</a>!
        </p>
        <strong>Q. Where can I see the source code?</strong>
        <p>
            A. For C++, <a href="https://github.com/JihunKimCode/Simple-CPPs/blob/main/N%20Queen%20Problem%20Solver.cpp" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">check this</a>!
            For this webpage, <a href="https://github.com/JihunKimCode/website/tree/main/N-queens" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">check this</a>! 
        </p>
        <strong>Q. Why does it sometimes fail or take too long time to find a solution?</strong>
        <p>
            A. First, it could be because the board size is too small to find the solution. Try a wider board.
            <br>Second, it's because the board was designed to use a randomized start column for the top-row queen to show the various possibility of the solution.
            <br>Try to "Solve" it again. Also, please remember it could take lots of time to solve a too-wide board.
